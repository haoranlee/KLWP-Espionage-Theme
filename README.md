# Espionage KLWP theme

A side project that I completed on 2 Sep 2019 or thereabouts. It is basically a custom [Kustom Live Wallpaper Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper) theme that I made for my phone homescreen, that as you can see, is fully interactive and conveniently shows me a lot of the information that I frequently need. I even added in a puzzle game I like to play while on the go (the puzzle grid where I can draw red or white squares - it's called a nonogram).

You can probably tell from my [previous theme](https://github.com/haoranlee/KLWP-Espionage-Theme) as well as this one that I have a thing for maximalist futuristic UIs. Gives me the cheap thrill of feeling like a cool secret agent whenever I use my phone.
